          <p>Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes/KDIGO recommends an average dose of 20 â€“ 25 mL/kg/hr. Other experts recommend maintaining a "dosing window" of 20-40 mL/kg/hr. See the Dosing section in the written material for more information.</p>

          <p>Filtration Fraction measures how much the plasma entering the filter is concentrated by ultrafiltration. It should be kept below 25% to reduce clotting. See the Non-pharmacologic approach to clotting for more information.</p>
